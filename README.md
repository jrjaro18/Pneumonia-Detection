**Weighted Voting CNN Model Ensemble for Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays**

This project investigates the application of ensemble learning techniques in medical image analysis, focusing on the classification of pneumonia from chest X-ray scans.<br>
The study explores the utilization of five pre-trained deep learning models—ResNet50, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, VGG19 and Inception-ResNetV2—combined with advanced data augmentation and optimization strategies.
